# Closing a Project

Only project authors can close their own projects.

A **"Close Project"** button appears on the project page ONLY for the creator.

Once clicked:
- The project becomes CLOSED.
- New join requests cannot be sent.
- Existing collaborators remain unchanged.
- The project is still visible publicly but labeled "Closed".

Closed projects cannot be reopened unless a reopening feature is implemented.
